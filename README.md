# Order.net
Sadly the code is from a decompiler, i lost the original in an format.
Order.net is a service that let's restaurants manage online orders.
Every table in the restaurant has a qr code that leads in a online menu form witch one can order.
This app is for the waiter to recieve the orders and edit the menu live whenever is needed.
Every order is carried through a Rest API and then dispayed in the app
